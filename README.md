# Resultity Website

This is the official website for **Resultity**, a decentralized AI inference platform.  
The site is built with **Next.js (App Router)** and implements a modern, modular design system with reusable React components.

## Features

- Multi-language structure (`/en`, `/ru`, `/id`)
- Product pages: Cloud, Node, Testnet, Tokenomics, Vision, Roadmap
- Custom UI components: layered backgrounds, interactive roadmap, infographics
- SEO metadata per page with localized dictionaries
- Tailwind + Bulma class mix for styling consistency
- Responsive design with mobile-first components

## Repository Structure

- `app/[lang]/` — localized pages
- `components/` — shared UI blocks and unisection system
- `public/` — static assets (favicon, images)
- `app/routes.ts` — centralized route keys

## Stage

This website tracks the **concept and pre-testnet stage** of Resultity.  
It serves as both an information hub (docs, roadmap, token draft) and as the entry point for community members and node operators.
